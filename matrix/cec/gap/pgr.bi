DIM AS STRING inputChar

PRINT "Press any key to see its ASCII value (press 'Q' to quit):"

DO
    ' Read a single character from the keyboard

'
'**Explanation:**
'
'1.  **`DIM AS STRING inputChar`**: Declares a string variable `inputChar` to store the character read from the keyboard.
'2.  **`PRINT "Press any key to see its ASCII value (press 'Q' to quit):"`**: Displays instructions to the user.
'3.  **`DO ... LOOP WHILE UCASE(inputChar) <> "Q"`**: This is a `DO...LOOP` that continues until the user presses 'Q' (case-insensitive).
'4.  **`inputChar = ""`**: It's good practice to clear the `inputChar` string before each `ACCEPT` call, especially if you're reading into a string, though `ACCEPT` itself will usually overwrite it.
'5.  **`ACCEPT inputChar AT 10, 10`**: This is the core of the example:
'    *   **`ACCEPT`**: This keyword instructs the program to wait for a single key press.
'    *   **`inputChar`**: The variable where the pressed character will be stored.
'    *   **`AT 10, 10`**: This is an optional clause that specifies the screen coordinates (row, column) where the character input will be echoed. If omitted, the character will be echoed at the current cursor position.
'6.  **`IF LEN(inputChar) > 0 THEN`**: Checks if a character was actually received. `ACCEPT` might return an empty string in some edge cases or environments, though usually it will get a character.
'7.  **`PRINT "You pressed: "; inputChar; " (ASCII: "; ASC(inputChar); ")"`**: Displays the character pressed and its ASCII (or extended ASCII) value using the `ASC()` function.
'8.  **`UCASE(inputChar) <> "Q"`**: Converts the input character to uppercase before comparing it to "Q", making the quit condition case-insensitive.
'9.  **`SLEEP`**: Pauses the program at the end until a key is pressed, so you can see the final output before the console window closes.
'
'**How to Compile and Run:**
'
'1.  Save the code as a `.bas` file (e.g., `accept_example.bas`).
'2.  Open a FreeBASIC command prompt or use an IDE.
'3.  Compile: `fbc accept_example.bas`
'4.  Run: `accept_example.exe`
'
'You will see the prompt, and as you press keys, the program will immediately react without needing you to press Enter.
'Now, let's create a visual representation of what the `ACCEPT` keyword might conceptually represent in FreeBASIC:

'' To create logic in FreeBASIC, you'll primarily use conditional statements like `IF...THEN...ELSE` and `SELECT CASE`, along with logical operators. Here's a breakdown of the common ways to do it:

'' ### 1. `IF...THEN...ELSE` Statements

'' This is the most fundamental way to create conditional logic.

'' **Basic `IF`:**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER score = 75

IF score >= 60 THEN
    PRINT "Passed!"
END IF
'' ```

'' **`IF...THEN...ELSE`:**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER temperature = 25

IF temperature > 30 THEN
    PRINT "It's hot!"
ELSE
    PRINT "It's not too hot."
END IF
'' ```

'' **`IF...THEN...ELSEIF...ELSE` (for multiple conditions):**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER grade = 85

IF grade >= 90 THEN
    PRINT "A"
ELSEIF grade >= 80 THEN
    PRINT "B"
ELSEIF grade >= 70 THEN
    PRINT "C"
ELSEIF grade >= 60 THEN
    PRINT "D"
ELSE
    PRINT "F"
END IF
'' ```

'' ### 2. Logical Operators

'' You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators:

'' *   **`AND`**: Both conditions must be true.
'' *   **`OR`**: At least one condition must be true.
'' *   **`NOT`**: Reverses the truth value of a condition.
'' *   **`XOR`**: One condition is true, but not both.

'' **Examples:**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER age = 20
DIM AS BOOLEAN hasLicense = TRUE

' AND operator
IF age >= 18 AND hasLicense THEN
    PRINT "Can drive legally."
END IF

' OR operator
DIM AS STRING weatherSunny = "sunny"
DIM AS STRING dayOfWeek = "saturday"

IF weatherSunny = "sunny" OR dayOfWeek = "saturday" THEN
    PRINT "Let's go to the park!"
END IF

' NOT operator
DIM AS BOOLEAN isRaining = FALSE

IF NOT isRaining THEN
    PRINT "It's a good day to go outside."
END IF
'' ```

'' ### 3. `SELECT CASE` Statements

'' `SELECT CASE` is excellent for handling multiple possible values of a single variable, offering a cleaner alternative to long `IF...ELSEIF` chains.

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER month = 3

SELECT CASE month
    CASE 1
        PRINT "January"
    CASE 2
        PRINT "February"
    CASE 3
        PRINT "March"
    CASE 4 TO 6 ' Range of values
        PRINT "Spring Quarter"
    CASE IS > 6 ' Condition
        PRINT "Later in the year"
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid month"
END SELECT
'' ```

''### 4. Loops for Iterative Logic

'' Loops (`FOR...NEXT`, `WHILE...WEND`, `DO...LOOP`) are used for repeating blocks of code, often with some conditional logic inside.

'' **`FOR...NEXT` loop:**

'' ```freebasic
FOR i AS INTEGER = 1 TO 5
    PRINT i
    IF i = 3 THEN
        PRINT "Halfway there!"
    END IF
NEXT i
'' ```

'' **`WHILE...WEND` loop:**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER count = 0
WHILE count < 5
    PRINT "Count: " & count
    count = count + 1
WEND
'' ```

'' **`DO...LOOP WHILE` or `DO...LOOP UNTIL`:**

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER guess
DIM AS INTEGER secret = 7

DO
    PRINT "Guess a number (1-10): ";
    INPUT guess
    IF guess < secret THEN
        PRINT "Too low!"
    ELSEIF guess > secret THEN
        PRINT "Too high!"
    END IF
LOOP WHILE guess <> secret

PRINT "You guessed it!"
'' ```

'' ### 5. Boolean Variables

'' You can use `BOOLEAN` variables to store `TRUE` or `FALSE` values, which are very useful for flags and logical states.

'' ```freebasic
DIM AS BOOLEAN gameIsOver = FALSE
DIM AS INTEGER playerHealth = 100

IF playerHealth <= 0 THEN
    gameIsOver = TRUE
END IF

IF gameIsOver THEN
    PRINT "Game Over!"
END IF
'' ```

'' ### Example: A Simple Decision-Making Program

'' Here's a small program that demonstrates combining several of these concepts to make a decision:

'' ```freebasic
' DECISION-MAKING PROGRAM

DIM AS STRING weather
DIM AS BOOLEAN hasUmbrella
DIM AS INTEGER temperatureCold

PRINT "What is the weather like today (sunny, cloudy, rainy)? ";
INPUT weather

PRINT "Do you have an umbrella (true/false)? ";
INPUT hasUmbrella

PRINT "What is the temperature in Celsius? ";
INPUT temperatureCold

PRINT "" ' New line for readability

' Logic to decide what to do
IF weather = "rainy" THEN
    IF hasUmbrella THEN
        PRINT "It's rainy, but you have an umbrella. You can go out."
    ELSE
        PRINT "It's rainy and you don't have an umbrella. Better stay inside!"
    END IF
ELSEIF weather = "sunny" AND temperatureCold > 25 THEN
    PRINT "It's sunny and hot! Great day for the beach."
ELSEIF weather = "cloudy" AND temperatureCold < 15 THEN
    PRINT "It's cloudy and a bit cold. Maybe wear a jacket."
ELSE
    PRINT "The weather is okay for various activities."
END IF

END
'' ```

'' This covers the main ways to implement logic in FreeBASIC. By combining these structures and operators, you can create complex decision-making processes in your programs.
'' Here's an illustration of how a `SELECT CASE` statement works in FreeBASIC:
'' `

'' Creating a logic port in FreeBASIC can be done by defining functions or subroutines that simulate the behavior of these gates. Here's how you can create an AND gate as an example:

'' ```freebasic
' AND Gate Simulation

'Function AndGate (inputA As Integer, inputB As Integer) As Integer
'    If inputA = 1 And inputB = 1 Then
'        Return 1
'    Else
'        Return 0
'    End If
'End Function

' Test the AND gate
Dim a As Integer
Dim b As Integer

a = 1
b = 0
'Print "Input A: "; a, "Input B: "; b, "Output AND: "; AndGate(a, b)

a = 1
b = 1
'Print "Input A: "; a, "Input B: "; b, "Output AND: "; AndGate(a, b)

a = 0
b = 0
'Print "Input A: "; a, "Input B: "; b, "Output AND: "; AndGate(a, b)

Sleep
'' ```

'' This code defines a function `AndGate` that takes two integer inputs (representing binary 0 or 1) and returns 1 if both are 1, otherwise 0. You can apply the same principle to create other logic gates.

'' Here's an image showing the symbolic representation of a common logic gate, the AND gate:

'' Would you like to see examples for other logic gates, like OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, or NOR?

''' ```
'''
''' **Explanation:**
'''
''' This FreeBASIC code demonstrates the fundamental concepts of a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**. Here's a breakdown:
'''
''' 1.  **`Type Node`**:
'''    *   This defines the structure for each node in the tree.
'''    *   `Data As Integer`: Stores the actual value of the node. You could change this to `String`, `Single`, or any other data type you need.
'''    *   `Left As Node Ptr`: A pointer to the left child node. In a BST, all values in the left subtree are less than the current node's data.
'''    *   `Right As Node Ptr`: A pointer to the right child node. In a BST, all values in the right subtree are greater than the current node's data.
'''
''' 2.  **`Function CreateNode(data As Integer) As Node Ptr`**:
'''    *   This function dynamically allocates memory for a new `Node` using `New Node`.
'''    *   It initializes the `Data` field with the provided value and sets both `Left` and `Right` pointers to `Null` (meaning no children initially).
'''    *   It returns a pointer to the newly created node.
'
''' 3.  **`Sub InsertNode(root As Node Ptr, data As Integer)`**:
'''     *   This is a recursive function to insert a new node while maintaining the BST property.
'''     *   **Base Case (Implicit):** If `root` is `Null`, it means we've found the correct spot to insert the new node (or the tree is empty).
'''     *   **Comparison:**
'''         *   If `data` is less than `root->Data`, we try to insert it into the left subtree.
'''         *   If `data` is greater than `root->Data`, we try to insert it into the right subtree.
'''         *   If `data` is equal to `root->Data`, it's a duplicate. This example simply prints a message, but you might choose to update the node, ignore it, or allow duplicates (which would change it from a strict BST).
'''     *   **Recursive Step:** If the target child pointer (`root->Left` or `root->Right`) is `Null`, we create the new node there. Otherwise, we recursively call `InsertNode` on the appropriate child subtree.
'
''' 4.  **Traversal Functions (`InOrderTraversal`, `PreOrderTraversal`, `PostOrderTraversal`)**:
'''    *   These are recursive functions that demonstrate different ways to visit all nodes in the tree.
'''     *   **`InOrderTraversal` (Left -> Root -> Right):** Visits nodes in ascending order of their data values (for a BST). This is often used to get sorted output.
'''     *   **`PreOrderTraversal` (Root -> Left -> Right):** Visits the root first, then its left subtree, then its right subtree. Useful for copying a tree.
'''     *   **`PostOrderTraversal` (Left -> Right -> Root):** Visits the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root. Useful for deleting a tree (to delete children before the parent).
'
''' 5.  **`Function SearchNode(root As Node Ptr, data As Integer) As Node Ptr`**:
'''     *   This recursive function searches for a node with a specific `data` value.
'''     *   **Base Case:** If `root` is `Null` (node not found) or `root->Data` matches the target `data`, it returns `root`.
'''     *   **Recursive Step:** Based on whether the target `data` is less than or greater than `root->Data`, it recursively searches the left or right subtree, respectively.
'
''' 6.  **`Main program`**:
'''     *   Initializes `root` to `Null` (an empty tree).
'''     *   Creates the first node using `CreateNode` and assigns it to `root`.
'''     *   Inserts several more nodes using `InsertNode`.
'''     *   Demonstrates the different traversal methods.
'''     *   Shows how to search for nodes in the tree.
'
''' **To compile and run this FreeBASIC code:**
'
''' 1.  Save the code as a `.bas` file (e.g., `tree.bas`).

''' 3.  Run the executable: `tree.exe` (on Windows) or `./tree` (on Linux/macOS).

'
''' Okay, when you say "FreeBASIC create list," it usually refers to creating a **linked list** or a similar dynamic data structure. FreeBASIC doesn't have a built-in `List` class like some other languages, so you typically implement them using pointers and user-defined types (UDTs).

''
''**Explanation:**
''
''1.  **`Type ListNode`**: This defines our custom data type for each element (or "node") in the list.
''    *   `Data As Integer`: This holds the actual value. You could change `Integer` to `String`, `Single`, or even another UDT to store more complex data.
''    *   `NextNode As ListNode Ptr`: This is the crucial part for a linked list. It's a pointer to another `ListNode`. This is how nodes are "linked" together.
''
''2.  **`Dim Shared Head As ListNode Ptr = NULL`**:
''    *   `Head` is a pointer that always points to the *first* node in the list.
''    *   `NULL` indicates that the list is initially empty.
''    *   `Shared` makes it accessible to all functions without passing it as a parameter, which is common for simple global list implementations. For larger projects, you might encapsulate this within a module or pass the head pointer around.
''
''3.  **`Sub AddToList(value As Integer)`**:
''    *   **`NewNode = New ListNode`**: This allocates memory for a new `ListNode` and makes `NewNode` point to it. `New` is FreeBASIC's operator for dynamic memory allocation for UDTs.
''    *   It then sets the `Data` and `NextNode` (initially `NULL` since it will be the last node).
''    *   **If `Head` is `NULL`**: The list is empty, so the `NewNode` becomes the `Head`.
''    *   **Else (list is not empty)**: It traverses the list using a `Current` pointer until it finds the last node (`Current->NextNode = NULL`). Then, it links the `Current` (last) node to the `NewNode`.
''
''4.  **`Sub PrintList()`**:
''    *   It starts from `Head` and iterates through each `Current` node.
''    *   For each node, it prints its `Data`.
''    *   It moves to the `NextNode` until `Current` becomes `NULL`, indicating the end of the list.
''
''5.  **`Sub ClearList()`**:
''    *   This is very important for dynamic data structures! If you don't `Delete` the memory you `New`ed, you'll have a memory leak.
''    *   It iterates through the list, `Delete`ing each node. The `Delete` operator frees memory previously allocated by `New`.
''    *   It's crucial to store `Current->NextNode` *before* `Delete Current`, otherwise, you'd lose the pointer to the next node.
''
''This is a fundamental example. You could extend this to:
''*   **Doubly Linked Lists**: Each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
''*   **Circular Linked Lists**: The last node points back to the head.
''*   **Insert at beginning/middle**: Add functions to insert nodes at specific positions.
''*   **Delete node**: Add functions to remove specific nodes.
''*   **Generic Data**: Use `Any Ptr` and type casting to make the list store any type of data, or use a `Variant` (though `Variant` has performance overhead).

''' 2.  **Organize your FreeBASIC code files into a project structure?** (e.g., using subdirectories for different modules.)
''' 3.  **Start a non-profit or group related to FreeBASIC programming?** (This would be outside of programming directly.)

''
''**Explanation:**
'
''1.  **`#include "windows.bi"`**: This line includes the necessary FreeBASIC bindings for the Windows API.
''2.  **`WindowProc` Function**: This is the core of any WinAPI application. It's a callback function that Windows calls to send messages to your window (e.g., when it's created, moved, closed, or a button is clicked).
''3.  **`WinMain` equivalent**: In FreeBASIC, the code outside of functions acts as the main entry point.
''    *   **`RegisterClassEx`**: Registers your custom window class with the operating system. This defines how your window will behave and look by default.
''    *   **`CreateWindowEx`**: Creates the actual window based on the registered class.
''    *   **`ShowWindow` and `UpdateWindow`**: Make the window visible.
''    *   **Message Loop**: This is a `DO WHILE` loop that continuously retrieves messages from the operating system and dispatches them to your `WindowProc` function. This is how your application remains responsive.
''4.  **`WM_CREATE`**: When your window is first created, Windows sends this message. This is where you typically create child controls like buttons, text boxes, etc.
''    *   **`CreateWindowEx` for Button**: Similar to creating the main window, but with different parameters:
''        *   `"BUTTON"`: Specifies the type of control.
''        *   `"Click Me!"`: The text displayed on the button.
''        *   `WS_TABSTOP OR WS_VISIBLE OR WS_CHILD OR BS_DEFPUSHBUTTON`: Various styles for the button (visible, child of the main window, default push button).
''        *   `10, 10, 100, 30`: Position (x, y) and size (width, height) of the button within the parent window.
''        *   `CAST(HMENU, 1000)`: A unique ID for your button. You'll use this ID to identify which button was clicked.
''5.  **`WM_COMMAND`**: This message is sent when a control generates an event (like a button being clicked).
''    *   `LOWORD(wParam)`: Contains the ID of the control that sent the message. We check if it matches our button's ID (1000).
''    *   `MessageBox`: Displays a simple message box when the button is clicked.
''6.  **`WM_CLOSE` and `WM_DESTROY`**: Handle the closing of the window and post a quit message to terminate the application.
'
''**How to Compile and Run:**
''
''1.  Save the code as a `.bas` file (e.g., `controls.bas`).
''2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
''3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
''4.  Compile it using the FreeBASIC compiler: `fbc controls.bas`
''5.  Run the executable: `controls.exe`
''
''You should see a simple window with a "Click Me!" button.
''
''Here's an illustration of what the window might look like:

''' What exactly do you mean by "freebasic create cat"? Do you want an image of a cat that is "freebasic" in style, whatever that might be? Or are you referring to the FreeBASIC programming language and want code to "create" a cat in some way (e.g., ASCII art, a simple graphic)?
'
''' If you want an image of a cat, here's one for you! 
'
''' Can you please clarify what you mean by "create view" in the context of FreeBASIC? Are you referring to:
'
''' 1.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI) elements?** Like creating a window or a control that displays information.
''' 2.  **Displaying graphics or images?** Such as setting up a screen mode to draw on.
''' 3.  **A specific programming concept** that uses the term "view"?
'
''' Once I have a better understanding, I can provide a more accurate example or explanation.
'
''' Could you please elaborate on what you mean by "freebasic create living"? Are you looking for code examples in FreeBASIC, or are you trying to create a "living" program in some other sense?
'
''' Once I understand your request better, I can help you with relevant information or even generate an image if that's what you're looking for!
'
''' FreeBASIC doesn't have a built-in `CREATE` or `UPDATE` command like a database language. You're likely thinking about how to create and modify data within a program.
'
''Could you clarify what you're trying to achieve? Are you looking to:
''
''1.  **Create/Update a file?** (e.g., text file, binary file)
''2.  **Create/Update data in memory?** (e.g., variables, arrays, user-defined types)
''3.  **Interact with an actual database?** (In which case you'd typically use a library for SQLite, MySQL, etc.)
''
''' Once you provide more context, I can give you a specific example or guidance.
'
''' For example, if you wanted to **create** a simple text file and **update** its content, it might look something like this:
'
''' ```freebasic
'' Create or overwrite a file
'OPEN "mydata.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
'PRINT #1, "This is the first line."
'PRINT #1, "This is the second line."
'CLOSE #1
'
'PRINT "File 'mydata.txt' created."
'
'' Read and then update the file (a bit more complex, often requires reading all, modifying, then rewriting all)
'' For simple append, you can use FOR APPEND
'
'' Example of appending to the file
'OPEN "mydata.txt" FOR APPEND AS #1
'PRINT #1, "This line was appended."
'CLOSE #1
'
'PRINT "File 'mydata.txt' updated by appending."
'
'' To demonstrate, let's read and print the content
'OPEN "mydata.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
'DIM lines AS String '' living list lines node script resurrect files
'WHILE NOT EOF(1)
'    LINE INPUT #1, lines '' create living static resurrect files
'    PRINT lines  '' create link living static files
'WEND
'CLOSE #1
''' ```
'
''' If you're dealing with data in memory, it's usually just assigning values to variables:
'
''' ```freebasic
'' Create a variable and assign a value
'DIM myNumber AS INTEGER = 10
'
'' Update its value
'myNumber = 20
'
'PRINT "myNumber is now: "; myNumber
'
'' Create an array
'DIM myArray(1 TO 3) AS STRING
'myArray(1) = "Apple"
'myArray(2) = "Banana"
'myArray(3) = "Cherry"
'
'' Update an element in the array
'myArray(2) = "Blueberry"
'
'PRINT "myArray(2) is now: "; myArray(2)
''' ```
'
''' Let me know your specific use case!
'
''I can help you with that! To create files in FreeBASIC, you'll typically use the `OPEN` statement. Here's a basic example of how to create a text file and write some content to it:
''
''```freebasic
'OPEN "myfile.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1
'PRINT #1, "Hello, FreeBASIC!"
'PRINT #1, "This is a test file."
'CLOSE #1
'
'PRINT "File 'myfile.txt' created successfully."
''```
''
''Let's break down what each line does:
'
''*   **`OPEN "myfile.txt" FOR OUTPUT AS #1`**:
''    *   `OPEN`: This keyword is used to open a file.
''    *   `"myfile.txt"`: This is the name of the file you want to create. If the file doesn't exist, FreeBASIC will create it. If it does exist, `FOR OUTPUT` will truncate it (erase its contents) before writing.
''    *   `FOR OUTPUT`: This specifies that you want to open the file for writing.
''    *   `AS #1`: This assigns a file handle (in this case, `#1`) to the opened file. You'll use this handle to refer to the file in subsequent operations.
''
''*   **`PRINT #1, "Hello, FreeBASIC!"`**:
''    *   `PRINT #1`: This is similar to the regular `PRINT` statement, but the `#1` tells FreeBASIC to write the output to the file associated with file handle `#1` instead of the console.
''
''*   **`CLOSE #1`**:
''    *   `CLOSE`: This statement closes the file associated with file handle `#1`. It's very important to close files after you're done with them to ensure all data is written and resources are released.
''
''*   **`PRINT "File 'myfile.txt' created successfully."`**: This simply prints a confirmation message to the console.
''
''**Different File Modes:**
'
''You can open files in various modes depending on what you want to do:
''
''*   **`FOR OUTPUT`**: Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one. Good for starting fresh.
''*   **`FOR APPEND`**: Opens an existing file for writing, but adds new content to the end of the file without deleting existing content. If the file doesn't exist, it creates it.
''*   **`FOR INPUT`**: Opens an existing file for reading. If the file doesn't exist, it will cause a runtime error.
''*   **`FOR RANDOM`**: Used for random access files, where you can read or write data at any position within the file. This is more advanced and requires defining a record structure.
''*   **`FOR BINARY`**: Opens a file for reading and writing raw bytes. Useful for working with non-text data.
''
''**Example using `FOR APPEND`:**
''
'' ```freebasic
'OPEN "mylog.txt" FOR APPEND AS #2
'PRINT #2, "Log entry at " + STR(TIMER) ' Add a timestamp
'CLOSE #2
'
'PRINT "Appended to 'mylog.txt'."

'
''In FreeBASIC, you can create properties for a `TYPE` (similar to a class in other languages) using a combination of `GET` and `SET` accessors. This allows you to control how a member variable is read and written, providing encapsulation and data validation.
''
''Here's a basic example:
''
'' ```freebasic
'TYPE MyClass
'PRIVATE:
'    my_value_ AS INTEGER ' The actual private member variable
'
'PUBLIC:
'    ' Property for my_value_
'    'PROPERTY MyValue AS INTEGER
'    '    GET
'    '        RETURN my_value_
'    '    END GET
'    '    SET(value AS INTEGER)
'    '        IF value < 0 THEN
'    '            PRINT "Error: Value cannot be negative. Setting to 0."
'    '            my_value_ = 0
'    '        ELSE
'    '            my_value_ = value
'    '        END IF
'    '    END SET
'    'END PROPERTY
'
'    ' Constructor (optional, but good practice)
'    'DECLARE CONSTRUCTOR()
'    ''' CONSTRUCTOR()
'    '''    my_value_ = 0 ' Initialize the private member
'    'END CONSTRUCTOR
'END TYPE
'
'' Main program
'DIM obj AS MyClass
'
'' Set the property (calls the SET accessor)
''' obj.MyValue = 10
''' PRINT "MyValue is: "; obj.MyValue ' Calls the GET accessor
'
'' Try setting an invalid value
''' obj.MyValue = -5
''' PRINT "MyValue is: "; obj.MyValue
'
'' Set another valid value
''' obj.MyValue = 20
''' PRINT "MyValue is: "; obj.MyValue
'
'SLEEP
'' ```
'
''Let's break down the key parts:
''
''1.  **`TYPE MyClass`**: Defines your custom data type.
''
''2.  **`PRIVATE: my_value_ AS INTEGER`**:
''    *   `PRIVATE:`: This keyword makes `my_value_` accessible only from within the `MyClass` type itself. This is crucial for encapsulation, as it prevents direct external modification of the underlying data.
''    *   `my_value_`: This is the actual variable that holds the data for your property. The underscore is a common convention to denote private members.
''
''3.  **`PUBLIC: PROPERTY MyValue AS INTEGER`**:
''    *   `PUBLIC:`: Makes the property accessible from outside the `MyClass` type.
''    *   `PROPERTY MyValue AS INTEGER`: Declares a property named `MyValue` that will act like an `INTEGER`.
''
''4.  **`GET ... END GET`**:
''    *   This block defines the "getter" accessor.
''    *   When you read the property (e.g., `PRINT obj.MyValue`), the code inside this block is executed.
''    *   `RETURN my_value_`: It simply returns the value of the private member.
''
''5.  **`SET(value AS INTEGER) ... END SET`**:
''    *   This block defines the "setter" accessor.
''    *   When you assign a value to the property (e.g., `obj.MyValue = 10`), the code inside this block is executed.
''    *   `value AS INTEGER`: The value being assigned to the property is passed as an argument to the `SET` block.
''    *   `IF value < 0 THEN ... ELSE ... END IF`: This is where you can implement validation logic. In this example, it checks if the assigned value is negative and prevents it if so.
''
''6.  **`DECLARE CONSTRUCTOR()` and `CONSTRUCTOR()`**:
''    *   A constructor is a special sub-routine that gets called automatically when you create a new instance of your `TYPE` (e.g., `DIM obj AS MyClass`).
''    *   It's good practice to initialize your private member variables in the constructor to ensure they have a defined state.
'
''**Why use properties?**
''
''*   **Encapsulation:** You hide the internal implementation details (`my_value_`) from the outside world. Users of your `TYPE` interact only with `MyValue`.
''*   **Data Validation:** The `SET` accessor allows you to validate input before it's assigned to the private variable, ensuring data integrity.
''*   **Read-Only/Write-Only Properties:**
''    *   To create a **read-only** property, simply omit the `SET` block.
''    *   To create a **write-only** property (less common), omit the `GET` block.
''*   **Computed Properties:** The `GET` or `SET` accessors can contain complex logic, including calculations, database lookups, or interaction with other objects, rather than just directly accessing a private field.
''
''Properties are a fundamental feature for creating robust and maintainable code in object-oriented programming paradigms, and FreeBASIC provides a straightforward way to implement them.
