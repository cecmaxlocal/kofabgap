'' FreeBASIC doesn't have a built-in "list" data type like some other languages (e.g., Python lists or C++ `std::list`). However, you can implement linked lists in FreeBASIC using user-defined types (UDTs) and pointers.

'' Here's a basic example of how you could create a singly linked list in FreeBASIC, along with functions to add to the list and print its contents:

'' ```freebasic
' Define the node structure for our linked list
Type ListCout
    Data As Integer    ' The data this node will hold
    NextNode As ListCout Ptr ' Pointer to the next node in the list
End Type

' Function to add a new node to the beginning of the list
Sub AddToList(ByRef Head As ListCout Ptr, NewData As Integer)
    Dim NewNode As ListCout Ptr
    NewNode = New ListCout       ' Allocate memory for the new node
    NewNode->Data = NewData      ' Set the data for the new node
    NewNode->NextNode = Head     ' Point the new node to the current head
    Head = NewNode               ' Make the new node the new head
End Sub

' Function to print the contents of the list
Sub PrintList(Head As ListCout Ptr)
    Dim Current As ListCout Ptr
    Current = Head
    If Current = NULL Then
        Print "List is empty."
        Return
    End If
    Print "List contents:"
    While Current <> NULL
        Print Current->Data
        Current = Current->NextNode
    Wend
End Sub

' Main program
Dim MyList As Any Ptr ' Initialize the head of the list to NULL

' Add some elements to the list
AddToList(MyList, 10)
AddToList(MyList, 20)
AddToList(MyList, 30)
AddToList(MyList, 40)

' Print the list
PrintList(MyList)

' --- Important: Freeing memory ---
' In FreeBASIC, you need to manually free memory allocated with NEW.
' Failure to do so will result in memory leaks.
Sub FreeList(ByRef Head As ListCout Ptr)
    Dim Current As ListCout Ptr
    Dim Next_Node As ListCout Ptr

    Current = Head
    While Current <> NULL
        Next_Node = Current->NextNode
        Delete Current ' Free the memory for the current node
        Current = Next_Node
    Wend
    Print " Headers: "; Head  ' Set the head to NULL after freeing
End Sub

' Call FreeList when you are done with the list
FreeList(MyList)

Sleep

'**Explanation:**
'
'1.  **`Type ListNode`**: This defines the structure of a single node in your linked list.
'    *   `Data As Integer`: This holds the actual information for that node (you could change `Integer` to any other data type like `String`, `Single`, or another UDT).
'    *   `NextNode As ListNode Ptr`: This is a pointer to the *next* `ListNode` in the sequence. This is what "links" the nodes together.
'
'2.  **`Dim MyList As ListNode Ptr = NULL`**: This declares a pointer named `MyList` which will serve as the "head" of our linked list. It's initialized to `NULL` to indicate that the list is empty.
'
'3.  **`Sub AddToList(ByRef Head As ListNode Ptr, NewData As Integer)`**:
'    *   `ByRef Head As ListNode Ptr`: The `Head` pointer is passed `ByRef` because we might need to change what `Head` points to (if we're adding to the beginning of the list).
'    *   `NewNode = New ListNode`: This allocates memory for a new `ListNode` on the heap and returns a pointer to it.
'    *   `NewNode->Data = NewData`: Assigns the provided data to the `Data` member of the new node.
'    *   `NewNode->NextNode = Head`: The `NextNode` of the new node is set to point to whatever the current `Head` is pointing to. This links the new node to the rest of the list.
'    *   `Head = NewNode`: The `Head` pointer is updated to point to the `NewNode`, effectively making it the new first element.
'
'4.  **`Sub PrintList(Head As ListNode Ptr)`**:
'    *   This function iterates through the list, starting from the `Head`.
'    *   `While Current <> NULL`: It continues as long as `Current` is not a `NULL` pointer (meaning it hasn't reached the end of the list).
'    *   `Print Current->Data`: Prints the data of the current node.
'    *   `Current = Current->NextNode`: Moves the `Current` pointer to the next node in the list.
'
'5.  **`Sub FreeList(ByRef Head As ListNode Ptr)`**:
'    *   **Crucial for memory management!** Since you manually allocate memory with `New`, you must manually deallocate it with `Delete` to prevent memory leaks.
'    *   This function iterates through the list and `Delete`s each `ListNode`, freeing the memory it occupied.
'
'**How to expand this:**
'
'*   **Doubly Linked List:** Each node would have `PrevNode` and `NextNode` pointers.
'*   **Insert at specific position:** You'd need to traverse the list to find the insertion point.
'*   **Delete a node:** Similar to insertion, you'd find the node and adjust pointers of its neighbors.
'*   **Search for a node:** Traverse the list, comparing `Data` values.
'*   **Generic Data Type:** You could use `Any Ptr` for `Data` and cast it back to the specific type when retrieving, or create multiple list types for different data. For more complex scenarios, you might use a `Variant` type or store UDTs directly.

'This example provides the foundational understanding for implementing linked lists in FreeBASIC. While it requires more manual work than languages with built-in list types, it offers a great way to learn about data structures and memory management.
