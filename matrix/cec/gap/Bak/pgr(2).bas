'PGR (Program Global Register) analysis in FreeBASIC typically refers to understanding how variables and program flow are managed across different parts of your code. While FreeBASIC doesn't have a formal "PGR" like some other languages or environments might, we can break down how you'd analyze similar concepts:
'
'**1. Variable Scope and Lifetime:**
'
'*   **Global Variables:** Declared outside of any function or `SUB` and are accessible from anywhere in your program.
'    ```freebasic
    DIM SHARED globalVar AS INTEGER = 10 ' SHARED makes it truly global
    
    SUB printGlobal()
        PRINT globalVar
    END SUB
    
    globalVar = 20
    printGlobal
'    ```
'    Analysis: Tracking `globalVar` means understanding every place it's read or written throughout your entire codebase. Changes in one part of the program will affect others.
'
'*   **Local Variables:** Declared inside a function or `SUB`. Their existence is limited to that specific block of code.
'    ```freebasic
    SUB calculateSum(a AS INTEGER, b AS INTEGER)
        DIM localSum AS INTEGER ' localSum only exists within calculateSum
        localSum = a + b
        PRINT localSum
    END SUB
    
    calculateSum(5, 7)
    ' PRINT localSum ' This would cause an error
'    ```
'    Analysis: Local variables simplify reasoning. You only need to consider their usage within their specific function.
'
'*   **Static Variables:** Local variables that retain their value between calls to the function.
'    ```freebasic
    SUB counter()
        STATIC callCount AS INTEGER = 0
        callCount = callCount + 1
        PRINT "Called: "; callCount; " times"
    END SUB
    
    counter
    counter
    counter
'    ```
'    Analysis: Static variables introduce a dependency on the history of function calls. Their state persists, so you need to track their value across multiple invocations.
'
'**2. Procedure (Function/SUB) Call Flow:**
'
'Understanding the order in which `SUB`s and `FUNCTION`s are called is crucial for PGR analysis.
'
'*   **Sequential Execution:** FreeBASIC generally executes code top-down.
'*   **Call Stack:** When a `SUB` or `FUNCTION` is called, the program's current state (return address, local variables for the caller) is pushed onto a conceptual "call stack." When the procedure finishes, control returns to where it was called.
'*   **Recursion:** A procedure calling itself. This can lead to deep call stacks.
'    ```freebasic
    FUNCTION factorial(n AS INTEGER) AS LONG
        IF n = 0 THEN
            RETURN 1
        ELSE
            RETURN n * factorial(n - 1)
        END IF
    END FUNCTION
    
    PRINT factorial(5)
'    ```
'    Analysis: For recursive functions, you need to trace the execution path for each recursive call and understand how the base case terminates the recursion.
'
'**3. Data Structures and Pointers:**
'
'FreeBASIC supports various data types, including user-defined types (UDTs) and pointers, which significantly impact how data is managed.
'
'*   **User-Defined Types (UDTs):** Group related data together.
'    ```freebasic
    TYPE Employee
        ID AS INTEGER
        Name AS STRING * 50
        Salary AS SINGLE
    END TYPE
    
    DIM emp1 AS Employee
    emp1.ID = 101
    emp1.Name = "Alice"
    emp1.Salary = 50000.0
'    ```
'    Analysis: When UDTs are passed by value, a copy is made. When passed by reference or accessed via pointers, changes affect the original data.
'
'*   **Pointers:** Allow direct memory manipulation.
'    ```freebasic
    DIM myInt AS INTEGER = 10
    DIM ptrToIntAllow AS INTEGER PTR
    
    ptrToIntAllow = @myInt ' ptrToInt now holds the memory address of myInt
    
    PRINT myInt
    '' !ptrToInt = 20    ' Dereference ptrToInt to change the value at its address
    PRINT myInt
'    ```
'    Analysis: Pointers require careful tracking. A change through a pointer can affect data that seems unrelated in the source code. Memory leaks or access violations are common issues if pointers are mishandled.
'
'**4. External Libraries and File I/O:**
'
'Programs often interact with external resources.
'
'*   **External Libraries (DLLs, .SO files):** FreeBASIC can call functions in external libraries.
'    Analysis: Understanding how data is passed to and from these libraries, and what side effects they might have, is part of a complete program analysis.
'
'*   **File I/O:** Reading from and writing to files.
'    Analysis: Changes to files are persistent and affect subsequent program runs or other applications that access those files.
'
'**How to Perform PGR-like Analysis in FreeBASIC:**
'
'Since there's no built-in "PGR analyzer," you typically rely on:
'
'*   **Code Reading and Review:** The most fundamental method. Systematically read through your code, tracing variable usage and function calls.
'*   **Comments and Documentation:** Well-commented code greatly aids understanding.
'*   **Debugging Tools:** Using a debugger (like the one integrated into FBEdit, Geany with GDB, or others) to step through code execution, inspect variable values at different points, and trace the call stack.
'*   **Print/Logging Statements:** Temporarily adding `PRINT` statements or a logging mechanism to output variable values and execution flow.
'*   **Static Analysis Tools (Limited for FreeBASIC):** While not as common as for languages like C++ or Java, some generic linters or code complexity analyzers *might* provide some insights, but they won't be FreeBASIC-specific for deep "PGR" style analysis.
'*   **Flowcharting/UML (Manual):** For complex logic, drawing flowcharts for functions or call graphs can be incredibly helpful.
'
'Let's illustrate with a simple example:
'
'Consider this FreeBASIC snippet:
' ```freebasic
DIM SHARED counterValue AS INTEGER = 0

FUNCTION incrementCounter(value AS INTEGER) AS INTEGER
    counterValue = counterValue + value
    RETURN counterValue
END FUNCTION

SUB main()
    DIM result1 AS INTEGER
    DIM result2 AS INTEGER
    
    result1 = incrementCounter(5)
    PRINT "Counter after first call: "; result1
    
    result2 = incrementCounter(10)
    PRINT "Counter after second call: "; result2
    
    PRINT "Final counterValue: "; counterValue
END SUB

' Entry point
main
'```
'
'**PGR Analysis:**
'
'1.  **`counterValue` (Global):**
'    *   **Declaration:** `DIM SHARED counterValue AS INTEGER = 0` - Global, initialized to 0.
'    *   **Access:** Modified within `incrementCounter`. Read directly in `main` at the end.
'    *   **Lifetime:** Entire program execution.
'    *   **Impact:** Any function can modify it. Changes are persistent across calls to `incrementCounter`.
'
'2.  **`incrementCounter` Function:**
'    *   **Input:** `value AS INTEGER` (passed by value).
'    *   **Output:** Returns `counterValue` (an `INTEGER`).
'    *   **Side Effect:** Modifies the global `counterValue`.
'    *   **Flow:** Adds `value` to `counterValue`, then returns the new `counterValue`.
'
'3.  **`main` SUB:**
'    *   **`result1`, `result2` (Local):**
'        *   **Declaration:** Local to `main`.
'        *   **Lifetime:** Only within `main`.
'        *   **Impact:** Store the return value of `incrementCounter` at specific points.
'
'    *   **Call Flow:**
'        1.  `incrementCounter(5)` is called. `counterValue` becomes 5. `result1` gets 5.
'        2.  `PRINT` statement.
'        3.  `incrementCounter(10)` is called. `counterValue` (which was 5) becomes 5 + 10 = 15. `result2` gets 15.
'        4.  `PRINT` statement.
'        5.  `PRINT` statement directly accessing the global `counterValue`, which is 15.
'
'**Visualizing the Flow:**
'
'Here's a simple flowchart representation for a basic `PGR` analysis.
'`
'' This diagram summarizes the elements involved in "PGR-like" analysis within FreeBASIC, covering variable scope, 
'' procedure calls, data structures, and external interactions.

'To create a "start drizzle" script in FreeBASIC, you'll generally be interacting with the command line or system to initiate a process. Assuming "drizzle" refers to a separate executable or command you want to run, here's a basic FreeBASIC script that demonstrates how to do this using the `SHELL` command.
'
'This example will simply execute a command-line command. If "drizzle" is a specific program, you'd replace `"your_drizzle_command_here"` with the actual command to start it.
'
'```freebasic
' start_drizzle.bas

' This program will attempt to execute a command as if typed in the command prompt.
' Replace "your_drizzle_command_here" with the actual command to start your drizzle process.
' For example, if "drizzle" is an executable in the current directory, it might be "drizzle.exe".
' If it's a system command, just use the command itself.

' --- Example 1: Running a simple system command (e.g., listing files) ---
PRINT "Attempting to run a test command (e.g., 'dir' on Windows or 'ls' on Linux/macOS)..."
#IF DEFINED(__FB_WIN32__)
    ' For Windows
    SHELL "dir"
#ELSE
    ' For Linux/macOS
    SHELL "ls"
#ENDIF
PRINT "Test command executed."
PRINT ""

' --- Example 2: Running your actual "drizzle" command ---
' IMPORTANT: Replace this placeholder with your real drizzle command.
' If drizzle is an executable, make sure its path is correct or it's in your system's PATH.
DIM drizzleCommand AS STRING
drizzleCommand = "your_drizzle_command_here" ' <--- CHANGE THIS TO YOUR ACTUAL DRIZZLE COMMAND

PRINT "Attempting to start drizzle with command: '" & drizzleCommand & "'"

' The SHELL command executes a command in a new shell.
' This might open a new command window or run in the background depending on the OS and command.
SHELL drizzleCommand

PRINT "Drizzle command has been sent to the system."
PRINT "Depending on how 'drizzle' works, it may now be running in the background,"
PRINT "or it might have opened its own window, or it might have exited quickly."
PRINT ""
PRINT "Press any key to exit this FreeBASIC program."
SLEEP
END
'```
'
'**How to use this script:**
'
'1.  **Save:** Save the code above as `start_drizzle.bas` (or any `.bas` filename).
'2.  **Edit `drizzleCommand`:**
'    *   **Crucially, change `drizzleCommand = "your_drizzle_command_here"`** to the actual command you use to start "drizzle."
'    *   **Examples:**
'        *   If `drizzle.exe` is in the same directory: `drizzleCommand = "drizzle.exe"`
'        *   If it's a full path: `drizzleCommand = "C:\Path\To\Your\Drizzle\drizzle.exe"` (Windows)
'        *   If it's a Linux/macOS command: `drizzleCommand = "/usr/bin/drizzle"` (or just `"drizzle"` if it's in your PATH)
'        *   If it's a script you want to run: `drizzleCommand = "python mydrizzlescript.py"`
'3.  **Compile:** Open a FreeBASIC command prompt and compile the script:
'    ```bash
'    fbc start_drizzle.bas
'    ```
'    This will create an executable file (e.g., `start_drizzle.exe` on Windows, `start_drizzle` on Linux/macOS).
'4.  **Run:** Execute the compiled program:
'    ```bash
'    ./start_drizzle  (on Linux/macOS)
'    start_drizzle.exe (on Windows)
'    ```
'
'**Explanation:**
'
'*   **`SHELL command_string`**: This is the core FreeBASIC command. It executes the `command_string` as if you typed it directly into your operating system's command prompt or terminal.
'*   **`#IF DEFINED(__FB_WIN32__)` / `#ELSE` / `#ENDIF`**: This is a preprocessor directive that allows you to include different code depending on the operating system FreeBASIC is compiling for. It's used here to show platform-specific test commands (`dir` for Windows, `ls` for Linux/macOS).
'*   **`PRINT`**: Displays messages to the console.
'*   **`SLEEP`**: Pauses the program until a key is pressed. This is useful so the console window doesn't immediately close after running the `SHELL` command, allowing you to read the output.
'*   **`END`**: Terminates the program.
'
'This approach is simple and effective for starting external programs from a FreeBASIC script. If "drizzle" requires more complex interaction (like sending input or reading output), you'd need to look into more advanced inter-process communication techniques, which are beyond a simple "start script."

' To create a PGR (Programmer's Guide and Reference) about `SELECT CASE` in FreeBASIC, you'll want to cover its syntax, purpose, examples, 
' and common use cases. Here's a structured approach:

Dim expression As Long
Dim value1 As Byte
Dim value2 As Byte
Dim value3 As Byte
Dim value4 As Byte
Dim Value5 As Byte
Dim value6 As Byte

'
'## Programmer's Guide and Reference: `SELECT CASE` in FreeBASIC
'
'### 1. Introduction to `SELECT CASE`
'
'The `SELECT CASE` statement in FreeBASIC provides a multi-way branch based on the value of a single expression. It's a more structured and often more readable alternative to a long series of `IF...THEN...ELSEIF...THEN...END IF` statements when you have many possible outcomes based on one variable or expression.
'
'### 2. Purpose and Benefits
'
'The primary purpose of `SELECT CASE` is to simplify conditional logic where different actions are taken based on distinct values or ranges of an expression.
'
'**Benefits include:**
'
'*   **Readability:** It makes code easier to understand and maintain, especially with many conditions.
'*   **Efficiency:** For certain scenarios, it can be more efficient than nested `IF` statements.
'*   **Structure:** It provides a clear and organized way to handle multiple choices.
'
'### 3. Syntax
'
'The basic syntax for `SELECT CASE` is as follows:
'
' ```freebasic
SELECT CASE expression
    CASE value1
        ' Statements to execute if expression = value1
    CASE value2, value3
        ' Statements to execute if expression = value2 OR expression = value3
    CASE value4 TO value5
        ' Statements to execute if expression is between value4 and value5 (inclusive)
    CASE IS > value6
        ' Statements to execute if expression is greater than value6
    CASE ELSE
        ' Statements to execute if no other CASE matches
END SELECT
'```
'
'**Explanation of Components:**
'
'*   **`expression`**: This is the value (a variable, literal, or calculation) that will be evaluated. It can be of any scalar type (numeric, string, or user-defined type if comparison operators are defined).
'*   **`CASE`**: Each `CASE` clause specifies one or more conditions.
'    *   **`value`**: A single literal value to match exactly.
'    *   **`value1, value2`**: A comma-separated list of values. The `CASE` matches if the `expression` equals any of these values.
'    *   **`value1 TO value2`**: A range of values (inclusive). The `CASE` matches if the `expression` falls within this range. `value1` must be less than or equal to `value2`.
'    *   **`IS operator value`**: Uses comparison operators (`=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`) with a value. The `IS` keyword is required when using comparison operators. Note that `IS = value` is equivalent to `value`.
'    *   **`CASE ELSE`**: This optional clause is executed if the `expression` does not match any of the preceding `CASE` clauses. It acts as a catch-all.
'*   **`END SELECT`**: Terminates the `SELECT CASE` block.
'
'### 4. Detailed Examples
'
'#### Example 1: Simple Numeric Match
'
' ```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER choice

PRINT "Enter a number (1-3):"
INPUT choice

SELECT CASE choice
    CASE 1
        PRINT "You chose One."
    CASE 2
        PRINT "You chose Two."
    CASE 3
        PRINT "You chose Three."
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid choice. Please enter 1, 2, or 3."
END SELECT
'```
'
'#### Example 2: Matching Multiple Values and Ranges
'
'```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER scoreCold

PRINT "Enter your test score (0-100):"
INPUT score

SELECT CASE score
    CASE 90 TO 100
        PRINT "Excellent! Grade: A"
    CASE 80 TO 89
        PRINT "Very Good! Grade: B"
    CASE 70 TO 79
        PRINT "Good! Grade: C"
    CASE 60 TO 69
        PRINT "Pass! Grade: D"
    CASE IS < 60
        PRINT "Fail! Grade: F"
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid score entered."
END SELECT
'```
'
'#### Example 3: String Matching
'
'```freebasic
DIM AS STRING NewsLetters

PRINT "Enter a command (start, stop, pause, exit):"
INPUT command

SELECT CASE LCASE(NewsLetters) ' Use LCASE for case-insensitive comparison
    CASE "start"
        PRINT "Starting process..."
    CASE "stop"
        PRINT "Stopping process..."
    CASE "pause"
        PRINT "Pausing process..."
    CASE "exit", "quit" ' Multiple string matches
        PRINT "Exiting application."
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Unknown command."
END SELECT
'```
'
'#### Example 4: Mixed `CASE` Conditions
'
'```freebasic
DIM AS INTEGER ageNew

PRINT "Enter your age:"
INPUT age

SELECT CASE age
    CASE 0 TO 12
        PRINT "You are a child."
    CASE 13 TO 19
        PRINT "You are a teenager."
    CASE 20, 21 ' Specific ages
        PRINT "You are an emerging adult."
    CASE IS > 21
        PRINT "You are an adult."
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Age cannot be negative."
END SELECT
'```
'
'### 5. Important Considerations and Best Practices
'
'*   **Order of `CASE` clauses:** The `CASE` clauses are evaluated in the order they appear. Once a match is found, the statements for that `CASE` are executed, and the `SELECT CASE` block is exited (it does not "fall through" to the next `CASE` like some other languages).
'*   **Overlapping Ranges:** Be careful with overlapping ranges. The first `CASE` that matches will be executed.
'    ```freebasic
    DIM AS INTEGER x = 5
    SELECT CASE x
        CASE 1 TO 5
            PRINT "In 1 to 5" ' This will be executed
        CASE 5 TO 10
            PRINT "In 5 to 10" ' This will NOT be executed
    END SELECT
'    ```
'*   **`CASE ELSE`:** Always consider including a `CASE ELSE` clause to handle unexpected or unhandled values of the expression. This makes your code more robust.
'*   **Expression Type:** The `expression` and the values in the `CASE` clauses should be compatible types.
'*   **Clarity:** While powerful, avoid overly complex `CASE` conditions that become difficult to read. If conditions become extremely intricate, other control structures or functions might be more appropriate.
'*   **`IS` Keyword:** Remember to use `IS` when using comparison operators other than `=`.
'
'### 6. Comparison with `IF...THEN...ELSEIF`
'
'| Feature           | `SELECT CASE`                                  | `IF...THEN...ELSEIF`                                     |
'| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
'| **Expression**    | Single expression evaluated once.              | Separate logical expression for each `IF`/`ELSEIF`.      |
'| **Readability**   | High for many distinct values/ranges.          | Can become cluttered with many `ELSEIF`s.                |
'| **Flexibility**   | Excellent for value/range-based decisions.     | More flexible for complex, unrelated logical conditions. |
'| **Fall-through**  | No implicit fall-through (executes one block). | No fall-through.                                         |
'| **Syntax**        | More structured for multi-way branching.       | Linear, sequential checks.                               |
'
'Use `SELECT CASE` when you are checking a single expression against multiple possible values or ranges. Use `IF...THEN...ELSEIF` when you have entirely different, unrelated conditions or complex boolean logic.
'
'### 7. Conclusion
'
'The `SELECT CASE` statement is an indispensable tool in FreeBASIC for writing clear, efficient, and maintainable code when dealing with multi-way decision-making based on a single expression. Mastering its syntax and understanding its best practices will significantly improve your FreeBASIC programming.
'
'---

'FreeBASIC's `SELECT CASE` statement is used to control program flow based on the value of an expression. It's similar to `if/elsif/else` but can be more readable for multiple conditions. There isn't a specific "level" to declare for `SELECT CASE`, but rather you declare variables that you then use within the `SELECT CASE` block.
'
'Here's how you declare and use `SELECT CASE` in FreeBASIC:
'
'**Basic Structure:**
'
'```freebasic
DECLARE FUNCTION GetChoice() AS INTEGER

DIM choiceLayout AS INTEGER
choiceLayout = GetChoice()

SELECT CASE choiceLayout
    CASE 1
        PRINT "You chose option 1"
    CASE 2
        PRINT "You chose option 2"
    CASE ELSE
        PRINT "Invalid choice"
END SELECT

FUNCTION GetChoice() AS INTEGER
    DIM userChoice AS INTEGER
    INPUT "Enter a number (1 or 2): ", userChoice
    RETURN userChoice
END FUNCTION
'```
'
'**Explanation:**
'
'1.  **`DECLARE FUNCTION GetChoice() AS INTEGER`**: This line declares a function named `GetChoice` that will return an `INTEGER` value. This is good practice when using functions.
'2.  **`DIM choice AS INTEGER`**: This declares a variable named `choice` of type `INTEGER`. This variable will hold the value that `SELECT CASE` evaluates.
'3.  **`choice = GetChoice()`**: This calls the `GetChoice` function and assigns its returned value to the `choice` variable.
'4.  **`SELECT CASE choice`**: This is the beginning of the `SELECT CASE` block. The expression `choice` is the one whose value will be compared against the `CASE` statements.
'5.  **`CASE 1`**: If the value of `choice` is `1`, the code under this `CASE` will execute.
'6.  **`CASE 2`**: If the value of `choice` is `2`, the code under this `CASE` will execute.
'7.  **`CASE ELSE`**: This is optional. If the value of `choice` does not match any of the preceding `CASE` statements, the code under `CASE ELSE` will execute.
'8.  **`END SELECT`**: This marks the end of the `SELECT CASE` block.
'9.  **`FUNCTION GetChoice() AS INTEGER ... END FUNCTION`**: This is the definition of the `GetChoice` function. It prompts the user for input and returns the entered number.
'
'**More Advanced `SELECT CASE` Usage:**
'
'You can use various forms for your `CASE` statements:

' *   **Multiple Values:**
'    ```freebasic
    SELECT CASE score
        CASE 90 TO 100
            PRINT "Grade A"
        CASE 70, 75, 80 ' Specific values
            PRINT "Good average"
        CASE IS < 70 ' Comparison operator
            PRINT "Needs improvement"
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Invalid score"
    END Select
 
 ' ```

'*   **Ranges:**
'    ```freebasic
    SELECT CASE age
        CASE 0 TO 12
            PRINT "Child"
        CASE 13 TO 19
            PRINT "Teenager"
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Adult"
    END Select
    
 Dim Cold As Byte
    
'    ```
'
'*   **Using `IS` for comparisons:**
'    ```freebasic
    SELECT CASE temperature
        CASE IS < 0
            PRINT "Freezing"
        CASE 0 TO 10
            PRINT "Cold"
        CASE IS > 25
            PRINT "Hot"
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Mild"
    END SELECT
'    ```
'
'*   **String comparisons:**
'    ```freebasic
    DIM commandFreebasic AS STRING
    commandFreebasic = "help" ' Or INPUT "Enter command: ", command

    SELECT CASE LCASE(commandFreebasic) ' Use LCASE for case-insensitive comparison
        CASE "help"
            PRINT "Displaying help..."
        CASE "quit", "exit"
            PRINT "Exiting program..."
        CASE ELSE
            PRINT "Unknown command."
    END SELECT
'    ```
'
'**Key Points:**
'
'*   The expression following `SELECT CASE` can be any type (integer, string, etc.), but all `CASE` expressions must be compatible with it.
'*   `CASE ELSE` is optional but highly recommended for handling unexpected values.
'*   Execution stops after the first matching `CASE` block is found.
'*   You can declare variables *before* the `SELECT CASE` statement that are then used *inside* it, as shown in the examples. There's no separate "declaration level" for `SELECT CASE` itself.

'The FreeBASIC `DECLARE` statement is used to declare a procedure (function or sub) before its definition. This is useful for forward declarations or when you define procedures in a different order than their calls.
'
'Let's break down your example: `Declare BlueBerry (ByRef SideList As MyDataType) As MyDataType`
'
'*   **`Declare`**: This keyword indicates that you are declaring a procedure.
'*   **`BlueBerry`**: This is the name of the procedure you are declaring.
'*   **`(ByRef SideList As MyDataType)`**: This is the parameter list.
'    *   **`ByRef`**: This keyword specifies that `SideList` will be passed by reference. This means that the procedure will receive the memory address of the original `SideList` variable, and any changes made to `SideList` within `BlueBerry` will affect the original variable.
'    *   **`SideList`**: This is the name of the parameter.
'    *   **`As MyDataType`**: This specifies the data type of the `SideList` parameter. `MyDataType` would need to be a previously defined data type (e.g., `INTEGER`, `STRING`, or a user-defined `TYPE`).
'*   **`As MyDataType`**: This specifies the return data type of the `BlueBerry` function. Since you're specifying a return type, `BlueBerry` is declared as a `FUNCTION`. If there were no `As MyDataType` at the end, it would be declared as a `SUB`.
'
'**In essence, this line declares a function named `BlueBerry` that:**
'
'1.  Takes one argument named `SideList`, which is passed by reference and is of type `MyDataType`.
'2.  Returns a value of type `MyDataType`.
'
'**Example Usage:**
'
'First, let's define `MyDataType` (e.g., as an `INTEGER` for simplicity, or a custom `TYPE`):
'
'```freebasic
' Define MyDataType (can be any valid FreeBASIC type or a custom TYPE)
TYPE MyBlueBerryType
    value AS INTEGER
END TYPE

' Declare the function BlueBerry
DECLARE FUNCTION Blue (ByRef SideList As Long) As Long

' Function definition
FUNCTION BlueBerry (ByRef SideList As Long) As Long
    ' Modify SideList (because it's ByRef)
    SideList = SideList * 2

    ' Create a return value
    DIM result AS Long
    result = SideList + 10

    FUNCTION = result ' Return the result
END FUNCTION

' Main program
DIM myVariable AS Long
myVariable= 5

PRINT "Original myVariable.value: "; myVariable

DIM returnedValue AS Long
returnedValue = BlueBerry(myVariable)

PRINT "myVariable.value after BlueBerry call: "; myVariable
PRINT "Returned value from BlueBerry: "; returnedValue
'```
'
'**Why use `DECLARE`?**
'
'1.  **Order Independence:** You can call `BlueBerry` before its actual `FUNCTION...END FUNCTION` block appears in your code.
'2.  **Modular Programming:** If you have procedures defined in separate `.bi` (include) files, the `DECLARE` statements in those files make the procedures available to your main program without needing to see the full definitions.
'3.  **Clarity:** It provides a quick overview of a procedure's signature.

'' Sure, here is the declaration for the `CalledList` function in FreeBASIC:

'' ```freebasic
Declare Function CalledList (ByRef SideList As Long) As Long
'' input blue berry shup more list
Type BlueBerryColt Alias "Cout"
          DetailsCout As Long
          DetailsMap As Long
          DetailsBlue As Long
End Type

Let SideList = 225*2
Let SideList = BlueBerryColt.DetailsCout
Let SideList = BlueBerryColt.DetailsMap
Let SideList = BlueBerryColt.DetailsBlue

'' called list notion blue berry
Select Case SideList
   Case 1:
           Print "Inital Blue Berry Show Cout"; BlueBerryColt.DetailsCout
   Case 2:
           Print "Inital Blue Berry Show Map"; BlueBerryColt.DetailsMap
   Case 3:
           Print "Inital Blue Berry Show Blue"; BlueBerryColt.DetailsBlue
   Case 4 To 5:
           Print "Inital Blue Berry Show..."
End Select

End

'' ```

'' This declares a function named `CalledList` that takes one argument:

'' *   `SideList`: A `Long` integer passed by reference (`ByRef`). This means the function can modify the original `SideList` variable passed to it.

'' The function itself is declared to return a `Long` integer.
 
'' This looks like a line of code from FreeBASIC, a BASIC compiler. It appears to be a function declaration.

'Let's break down what it means:
'
'*   **`DECLARE`**: This keyword is used in FreeBASIC to declare a function or sub-program before it's defined. This is good practice as it helps the compiler understand the function's signature and ensures correct type checking.
'*   **`BlueList`**: This is the name of the function being declared.
'*   **`(ByRef Menu As Long)`**: This is the parameter list for the function.
'    *   **`ByRef Menu`**: This indicates that the `Menu` parameter is passed by reference. This means that if the `BlueList` function modifies the `Menu` variable internally, those changes will affect the original variable passed from the calling code.
'    *   **`As Long`**: This specifies that the `Menu` parameter is of type `Long`, which typically represents a 32-bit integer.
'*   **`As Long`**: This part after the parentheses indicates the return type of the `BlueList` function. So, this function is expected to return a `Long` integer value.
'
'In summary, this line declares a function named `BlueList` that takes one parameter, `Menu` (which is a `Long` integer passed by reference), and returns a `Long` integer.
'
'If you were to define this function later in your FreeBASIC code, it might look something like this (just an example, the actual implementation would depend on what `BlueList` is supposed to do):
'
'```freebasic
' Function declaration

' Example usage

'
'**Explanation:**
'
'1.  **`CountWords` Function:**
'    *   This function iterates through the input `text`.
'    *   It uses a `inWord` flag to determine if it's currently inside a word.
'    *   When it encounters a non-whitespace character and `inWord` is `FALSE`, it increments the word count and sets `inWord` to `TRUE`.
'    *   When it encounters a whitespace character, it sets `inWord` to `FALSE`.
'
'2.  **`ToLower` Function:**
'    *   Simple function to convert an entire string to lowercase. This is useful for case-insensitive word counting.
'
'3.  **Main Program:**
'    *   **File Handling:**
'        *   It first creates a `sample.txt` file with some predefined content.
'        *   Then, it `OPEN`s the file for `INPUT` and reads its content line by line using `LINE INPUT #1, line`.
'        *   `fileContent` accumulates all lines, with a space added between lines to ensure words don't merge across line breaks.
'        *   `charCount` keeps track of the total characters read.
'    *   **Character Count:** Prints the `charCount`.
'    *   **Word Count:** Calls the `CountWords` function to get the total number of words.
'    *   **Specific Word Frequency:**
'        *   It prompts the user to `INPUT` a word to search for.
'        *   It converts both the `searchWord` and the words extracted from `fileContent` to lowercase using the `ToLower` function to ensure case-insensitive matching.
'        *   **Tokenization Loop:** This loop iterates through `fileContent` character by character.
'            *   It builds `currentWord` by appending letters and numbers.
'            *   When it encounters a non-alphanumeric character (which acts as a word separator), it checks if `currentWord` matches `searchWord`. If it does, `searchWordCount` is incremented, and `currentWord` is reset.
'            *   A final check is done after the loop for the last word in the file.
'
'**How to Compile and Run:**
'
'1.  Save the code as `text_analysis.bas` (or any `.bas` filename).
'2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
'3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
'4.  Compile using the FreeBASIC compiler:
'    ```bash
'    fbc -lang fb text_analysis.bas
'    ```
'5.  Run the executable:
'    ```bash
'    ./text_analysis
'    ```
'    (On Windows, it would be `text_analysis.exe`)
'
'**Further Enhancements for Text Analysis:**
'
'*   **Punctuation Handling:** The current word counting might include punctuation attached to words (e.g., "word."). You could modify the word-splitting logic to strip punctuation.
'*   **Stop Words:** For more meaningful analysis, you might want to filter out common words like "the," "a," "is," etc. (known as "stop words").
'*   **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their root form (e.g., "running," "runs," "ran" -> "run"). This is more advanced and usually requires external libraries in other languages, but you could implement basic versions.
'*   **Dictionary/Map for Frequencies:** For counting *all* word frequencies, you'd typically use a data structure like a hash map or dictionary (if available in FreeBASIC or implemented manually) to store each unique word and its count. FreeBASIC's built-in `HASH` type could be used for this.
'*   **Regex (Regular Expressions):** FreeBASIC has a `RegEx` library that can be used for more powerful pattern matching and tokenization, making word extraction and specific pattern searches much easier.
'*   **Error Handling:** Add error handling for file operations (e.g., if the file doesn't exist).

'This example provides a solid foundation for performing basic text analysis tasks in FreeBASIC.

'' To create a simple dialog box in FreeBASIC, you can use the `INPUT` or `MSGBOX` functions for very basic interactions, or a GUI library for more complex and customizable dialogs.

'' Here's an example using `MSGBOX` for a simple informational dialog:

'' ```freebasic
' Simple MSGBOX dialog
'' MSGBOX  "This is a simple message box!"
'' ```
'' This will display a small window with your message and an "OK" button.

'' For a dialog that prompts the user for input, you can use `INPUT`:

'' ```freebasic
' Simple INPUT dialog
DIM names AS STRING
INPUT "Enter your name: ", names
PRINT "Hello, " & names & "!"
'' ```
'' This will open a console-style input prompt. If you want a graphical input box, you can achieve it with `MSGBOX` and its various options:

'' ```freebasic
' Graphical input using MSGBOX (requires user to type in the box, not ideal for direct input)
DIM resultMsgBox AS INTEGER
DIM textInput AS STRING = ""
'' resultMsgBox = MSGBOX("Please enter some text:", , "Input Dialog", 1 OR 64, textInput) ' 1 for OK/Cancel, 64 for Information icon

IF result = 1 THEN ' If user clicked OK
    PRINT "You entered: " & textInput
ELSE
    PRINT "You cancelled the input."
END IF
'' ```
'' The above `MSGBOX` example with text input is a bit of a workaround. `MSGBOX` is primarily for displaying messages and getting button clicks, not direct text input into a field. For true graphical dialogs with input fields, buttons, and other controls, you would typically use a GUI library.

'' **Example using a hypothetical GUI library (conceptual, as FreeBASIC doesn't have a built-in standard GUI library that works this way out of the box without external libraries):**

'' If you were using an external GUI library like WinAPI (on Windows), GTK, or FLTK bindings for FreeBASIC, the code would look significantly different and involve creating window handles, controls, and event loops.

'' Here's a conceptual idea of what it might look like with a GUI library (not runnable without specific library setup):

'' For a simpler, cross-platform approach without external libraries, `MSGBOX` is your best bet for a quick graphical dialog. If you need more sophisticated GUI elements, you'll need to look into external libraries or use platform-specific APIs.
